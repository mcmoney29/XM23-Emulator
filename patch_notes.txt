v. 0.4.0 (Initial Commit)
- Created from version 0.3.4 (Lab #3 submission)
- All Lab 3 specific logic removed (print statments of instructions, etc.)

v. 0.4.1 (June 12, 2023)
- All instructions required for Assignment 1 are decoded into opcode and operands and sent to exectute();
  -> Instruction Count has been removed, deemed unecessary

v. 0.4.2 (June 14, 2023)
- Created execute.c and execute.handling
- Created execute logic for instructions BL to BRA
- Started instructions for ADD to SUBC
  -> Only ADDs are working, need to change function to accept values rather than
     register numbers such that 1's compliments can be sent in, as well as constants
