v. 0.4.0 (Initial Commit)
- Created from version 0.3.4 (Lab #3 submission)
- All Lab 3 specific logic removed (print statments of instructions, etc.)

v. 0.4.1 (June 12, 2023)
- All instructions required for Assignment 1 are decoded into opcode and operands and sent to exectute();
  -> Instruction Count has been removed, deemed unecessary

v. 0.4.2 (June 14, 2023)
- Created execute.c and execute.h
- Created execute logic for instructions BL to BRA
- Started instructions for ADD to SUBC
  -> Only ADDs are working, need to change function to accept values rather than
     register numbers such that 1's compliments can be sent in, as well as constants

v. 0.4.3 (Current Version)
- Finished implementation of ADD_SUB()
- Added DADD_Func()
- Added BCD to word_byte and word_byte to BCD
  -> BUG: BCD_NUM.word and nib array do not share memory locations.
- Added CMP_Func()
- Worked out PSW issue of not being able to update global PSW
- Added XOR through BIT functions
- Exection loop in main.c has been disabled for test statements
  -> Non-permantent solution
